The purpose of this project is to perform a modern statistical analysis from the **BODYFAT** dataset. Our methodology includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: to investigate the variables' distributions along with the outliers
- Data Cleansing: to clean the data by imputing some observations which areirrational and create a new cleaned dataset
- Statistical Model: to construct a model that effectively infers and describes the variables. This requires feature selections and model diagnostic part
- Shiny App: to develop a real-time web application and predict a bodyfat based on our model

### Content
- **data**
This contains both raw and cleaned data set.
- **code**
This contains R scripts for the analysis ranging from reading data, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, data modeling to model diagnostics as well as script for Shiny app.
- **image**
This contains images obtained from the code and analysis.
- **Executive Summary**
The two-page document that summarizes the analysis including the introduction, data cleaning, model selection and diagnostics as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
