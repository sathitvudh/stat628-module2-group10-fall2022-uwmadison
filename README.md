The purpose of this project is to perform a modern statistical analysis from the **BODYFAT** dataset. Our methodology includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: to investigate the variables' distributions along with the outliers
- Data Cleansing: to clean the messy data such as recalculate the irrational data and create a new cleaned dataset
- Statistical Model: to construct a model that effectively infers and describes the variables. This requires feature selections and model diagnostic part
- Shiny App: to visualize our result and to create a bodyfat predictor based on our model
